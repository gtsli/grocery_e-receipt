# LSTM Approach

This approach to understand receipt mappings involves the use of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Currently, there are too many classifications for this classifier to be trained on. The current model has not been tested yet, but has 90% train accuracy on 50k labels. 

## Running

Run LSTM.ipynb for the current LSTM implementation. 

### Prerequisites

Please install the following libraries with the command:
```
pip install keras
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

### Note

This implementation is still a work in progress - the models need to be tuned after more data cleaning has been applied.
